# Weather App

Simple Node.js Weather App

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS)

Install

```powershell
npm install
```

Run

```powershell
node server.js
# or, if you have a start script: npm start
```

Then open the app in your browser at the app's configured port (check `server.js` for the exact port, commonly `http://localhost:3000`).

Notes
- Create an `.env` for API keys or secrets — `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.
- This repository contains `server.js` as the entry point.
